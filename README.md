# My Website Resume

Status: Concluded

In this project I created a curriculum site to present my skills, experiences and projects in a more effective way where to build its main page, its portfolio page, its experience page and its certificates page always associating the construction of the ".html" files with the ".css" style file.
- To create the pages I structured my code with the tag "DOCTYPE", "html", and with a "head" and a "body" defining the information tags and the content tags. I also worked with lists as well as dealing with inline, block, and inline-block elements to break up my content effectively. I passed the coding information for the pages to the browser, created the title for the pages, imported external CSS files to help me with some of the styling, added an image to the main page, used ordered and unordered lists, used effective classes in my file ".css" to mark the repeated items, I created nice content divisions with the "div" tag and formatted a header for the pages. In addition, I performed transitions and transformations with elements, used external fonts, applied a gradient background to the pages and added opacity to the colors, among other things.
- Adjusted the page style according to the screen size of the device that accesses with a "viewport" meta tag and with media queries.
